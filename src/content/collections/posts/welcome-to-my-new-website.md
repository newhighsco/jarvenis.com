This is the first of hopefully many Blog posts here at jarvenis.com. Here's you'll find:

* **J**arv's latest videos
* **A**wesome merchandise
* **R**edirects to Jarv's Socials
* **V**ery exclusive access to our Community Hub

Huge thanks to **New High Score** for putting this together for me, be sure to check them out!

As well as the above, here we have a dedicated "**LIVE**" section which appears when we Livestream on YouTube (_very cool!_) and a soon to be added About Me section to learn more about Jarv and his unique British quirks!

Thanks again to New High Score and thanks to **EVERYONE** that's supported Jarv and the channel so far. None of this would be possible without you!

Remember, stay safe & stay awesome!
