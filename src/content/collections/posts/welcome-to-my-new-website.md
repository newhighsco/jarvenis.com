  you'll find:\n\n* **J**arv's latest videos\n* **A**wesome merchandise\n* **R**edirects
  to Jarv's Socials\n* **V**ery exclusive access to our Community Hub\n\nHuge thanks

  to learn more about Jarv and his unique British quirks!\n\nThanks again to New High
  Score and thanks to **EVERYONE** that's supported Jarv and the channel so far. None
  of this would be possible without you!\n\nRemember, stay safe & stay awesome!"
